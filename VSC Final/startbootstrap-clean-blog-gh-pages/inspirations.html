    <h1>Taylor Swift is my Inspiration</h1>
    <img src="assets/img/long pond studio sessions.webp" alt="Black and White Photo of Taylor Swift">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <div id="Introduction">When it comes to creativity and confidence, Taylor Swift is my hero. This is why.
            <ol>
                <li> Her unparalleled lyricism.
                    <ul><li> I read her songs like poetry. She has been quoted as saying that in her free time, she thinks about metaphors. Need I say more?</li></ul> <br>
                </li>
                <li> Embracing failure - her failsafe.
                    <ul><li> ''I never a single time woke up in the morning and thought, ‘You know what I’m going to do today? I’m gonna go innovate some stuff. Things need to be innovated and I’m going to be the one that does it... what I did do was try to make the right decision for me at the time, whether or not it had ever been successfully done before.'' </li></ul>
                    <ul><li> She continues to try things that haven't been seen in the industry before simply because she wants to, regardless of whether it is a guaranteed success. (Usually it is because, you know, it's Taylor, but yeah)</li></ul>
                </li> <br>
                <li>Expanding her creative reach.
                    <ul><li> Starting off by singing others' songs, she has progressed to the point where she is not only directing her own music videos and tours, but is branching out to work on films apart from her music. In an industry where women are told to stay in their lane, this is inspirational to me. </li></ul>
                <li>Her kindness.</li>
                    <ul><li>She stood for Harry Styles when he was booed even though he is her ex-boyfriend and she was the only one standing to show support. What a queen. </li></ul>
                    <ul><li>Taylor gushes about the talent she works with on her projects - namely, those who star in her music videos. She makes sure to show minorities and give them voices through her platform. </li></ul>
                </li>
            </ol>

        <h2>Deep Dive</h2>
            <div id="Explanation">Folklore and Evermore are two of the most lyrically complex albums she has written, and thereby two of my favorites. The songs individually tell stories through painting pictures of words mixed with perfect the perfect sonic match, and the songs together weave character-rich plots worthy of novels. </div> <br> <div id="ExplanationTwo">Don't take my word for it - watch the video and take hers. </div>

        <h2>A Thank You Letter (if you aren't taylor please don't read, thank you)</h2>
            <div id="LoveLetter">
                Dear Taylor,
                <br> <br>
                Some of my first memories are jamming out to your music with my dad driving home from school. I looked out the window dramatically to "You Belong With Me" when I had a crush on Erik Magnuson. I called my sister screaming when you dropped "Red". I listened to "This is me Trying" when I came home from my mission. Your music has been the soundtrack to my life and I wish nothing but the best for you. Even though I was unable to get Eras Tour tickets, I want you to know you have my full support and love forever and ever.
                <br> <br>
                Love, 
                <br>
                Julia
